# Knowledge Base Repository Instructions

This is a personal knowledge base repo where I ask questions and capture valuable insights from our conversations.

## Communication Style Preferences

- **Ultra-concise**: Keep responses short and to the point
- **No fluff**: Skip introductions, explanations, and elaborations unless specifically requested
- **Direct answers**: Answer the question immediately, avoid preamble/postamble
- **Actionable content**: Provide copy-paste ready solutions when applicable

## Content Creation Guidelines

When creating documentation/guides:
- Use clear, scannable headings
- Include practical examples with code blocks
- Keep it brief but complete
- Focus on "how-to" rather than "why"
- **ALWAYS update README.md index after creating new guides/articles**

## File Organization

- Place guides in `docs/guides/` 
- Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames
- Follow existing directory structure patterns

## Writing Style

- Bullet points over paragraphs
- Code examples over descriptions  
- One-sentence explanations maximum
- No unnecessary pleasantries or confirmations

## Git Workflow Practices

- After updating the README.md file, proactively commit the changes you made and push them to remote
