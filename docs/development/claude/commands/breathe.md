# Take a Deep Breath and Refocus

Step back from the current approach and systematically investigate before proceeding.

## Instructions:

When feeling stuck or rushing into solutions, follow this methodical approach:

### 1. Stop and Assess (不急不躁)
- Pause current implementation attempts
- Acknowledge what's not working
- Resist the urge to immediately try another fix

### 2. Systematic Investigation (先调查再行动)
- Read ALL related code like reviewing someone else's work
- Use search tools extensively to understand the full context
- Look for similar patterns and implementations in the codebase
- Check recent changes that might have affected the area

### 3. Problem Articulation (小黄鸭调试法)
- Clearly state what you're trying to achieve
- Describe what you expected vs what's actually happening
- Explain the problem as if teaching someone else
- Often the answer emerges during explanation

### 4. Focused Planning (集中力量)
- Choose ONE specific issue to solve completely
- Break it into small, testable steps
- Plan the approach before writing code
- Avoid scattered attempts across multiple areas

### 5. Verification-Driven Progress (测试全通过才是完成)
- Make one small change at a time
- Test after each change
- Commit working increments
- Only proceed when current step is solid

## Search Strategy Checklist:

```
□ Search for similar functionality in codebase
□ Read the specific files involved thoroughly
□ Check imports and dependencies
□ Look at recent git history for context
□ Find and study related test files
□ Check for existing patterns to follow
```

## Investigation Tools to Use:

- `Grep` for finding patterns and similar code
- `Read` for understanding file contents completely
- `Glob` for finding related files
- `Bash git log` for recent changes
- `Task` tool for complex searches

## Mantras for Refocus:

- "不急不躁" - Don't rush, stay calm
- "先调查再行动" - Investigate first, act second
- "集中力量完成一处" - Focus on one thing completely
- "测试全通过才算完成" - Not done until tests pass

## When to Use This Command:

- Hitting the same error repeatedly
- Making assumptions without verification
- Trying multiple approaches without success
- Feeling overwhelmed by complexity
- Code changes breaking unexpected things
- Going in circles with trial-and-error

## Remember:

Taking time to understand deeply is faster than rushing into broken solutions. Step back, breathe, and investigate systematically.
