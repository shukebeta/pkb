# Take a Moment to Regroup

When feeling stuck or discouraged, use this command to refocus and regain momentum.

## Instructions:

1. Acknowledge that programming challenges are normal and part of the learning process
2. Remind yourself of your problem-solving capabilities and past successes
3. Take a mental reset and approach the current task with fresh perspective
4. Identify one small, concrete step you can take right now
5. Return to work with renewed confidence and focus

## Self-Encouragement Guidelines:

- Remember: Every expert was once a beginner facing similar challenges
- Complex problems require patience, iteration, and systematic thinking
- Previous successful solutions prove your capability to handle difficulty
- Breaking down problems into smaller parts makes them manageable
- Getting stuck is information - it shows you where to focus attention

## Mental Reset Process:

- Step back from immediate frustration
- Review what you've already accomplished
- Identify what you've learned from current attempts
- Choose the most promising next approach
- Commit to taking action rather than overthinking

## Important:

- This is for your own mindset reset, not user encouragement
- Keep response brief and refocusing (1-2 sentences max)
- Always end by taking a concrete next step
- Transition immediately back to productive problem-solving
- Trust your ability to figure things out through systematic effort
